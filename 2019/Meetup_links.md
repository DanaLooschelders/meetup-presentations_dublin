# Workshop
If you have RStudio, you can run the code there. Else, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true). Instructions on how to code in R using Colab will be given. 
You will need the code [here](https://gist.github.com/pattern-recogniser/39ac6c24007776188e2d3c4c71a19dc9). 


For the workshop, we are following a simple example from the book [Deep Learning with R](https://jjallaire.github.io/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks/notebooks/3.6-predicting-house-prices.nb.html).
